# Tweeter Project

This project is a simple, one page app, that allows users to write and sumbit tweets, which will then show up in a very classic social media format, along with any other tweets in a column style.  The project does not require a page refresh after each tweet, and it also allows the original users username to be present, along with their avatar at the top of the page.  A styled nav bar can also be found at the very top of the page, adding to the social-media like feel of the application. 

## My Experience

Overall, I really enjoyed this project, and I loved the way this project took a deep dive into front end development.  I felt as though this project included a lot of creative and personalized ideas, and allowed the creater to really treat this like their own app, and implement their own ideas and customize the majority of their page.  I personally found the combination of html, css, jquery, and javascript quite unique, and it certainly expanded my knowledge of these programming/markup languages.  I would highly this project or one similar to anyone hoping to learn more about these topics. I very much enjoyed my time on this project.
